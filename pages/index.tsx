            I enjoy working mainly with Javascript and i am in love with it. I have majorly worked in the frontend and have professional experience working React, Vue and Angular, however in my free time i have spent time exploring svelte and solid recently.
            I also have used NodeJS for building APIs in my past experience along side docker, kubernetes and kafka. Though I have experience working as a full stack engineer i prefer frontend over backend.

            In my free time you will probably find me watching some random youtube video. However i do enjoy reading a few books, listen to podcasts. I recently came across this concept of stoicism and have been exploring about it. I do go to the gym once in a while. I also watch anime sometimes along side F1. <br />
